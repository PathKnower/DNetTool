# DNetTool

My thesis at the last year of study.

Technologies:
* .NET Core 3 preview
* SignalR 3 preview
* EFCore 3 preview
* Blazor preview

This is a platform which allows to build any systems by combining custom modeules. This platform has several features: 
* Architecture based on SOA and Microservices, but with some improvements.
* DNet_Communication (Base library) allows to collect system preferences on Windows and Linux systems
* Messaging inside platform isn't directed, this mean that any type of module can have a several instances (Cannot check the limits, but believe it can handle more than 100 modules)

This work was represented and I found an presentation file, but it only on RU language. Hope it helps to understand what I've done.

This platform doesn't contain all functionality what I want. It isn't ready by my opinion, but has several interesting things.
